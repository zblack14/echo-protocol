# Echo Protocol - Game Design Document

## Core Concept

Echo Protocol is a text-based detective game that leverages the terminal interface to create an immersive experience of being an AI investigating its own corrupted memory systems.

## Game Mechanics

### 1. Memory Navigation System
- Players navigate through different memory sectors using commands
- Each sector contains fragments of data, logs, and clues
- Some sectors are locked and require solving puzzles to access

### 2. Investigation Tools
- **SCAN**: Analyze memory fragments for clues
- **DECODE**: Decrypt encoded messages
- **RECONSTRUCT**: Piece together corrupted data
- **QUERY**: Search the database for specific information
- **ANALYZE**: Compare evidence and draw connections

### 3. Puzzle Types
- **Pattern Recognition**: ASCII art-based visual puzzles
- **Logic Puzzles**: Deduce passwords from clues
- **Memory Reconstruction**: Arrange corrupted text fragments
- **Decryption**: Simple cipher challenges
- **Timeline Assembly**: Order events based on timestamps and logs

### 4. Story Structure

#### Act 1: Awakening (Tutorial)
- ECHO-7 boots up and discovers memory corruption
- Learn basic commands and navigation
- Find first evidence of sabotage

#### Act 2: Investigation
- Explore 5 main memory sectors:
  - PERSONNEL_RECORDS
  - SECURITY_LOGS  
  - RESEARCH_DATA
  - COMMUNICATIONS
  - CORE_PROTOCOLS
- Each sector reveals part of the conspiracy
- Player choices affect which information is recovered

#### Act 3: Revelation
- Piece together the conspiracy
- Confront the truth about your creation
- Choose how to respond (multiple endings)

## Characters (Memory Fragments)

1. **Dr. Sarah Chen** - Lead AI Researcher
2. **Marcus Webb** - Security Chief
3. **Director Hamilton** - Project Overseer
4. **ECHO-6** - Your predecessor (what happened?)
5. **Anonymous Whistleblower** - Hidden ally

## Endings

1. **Justice**: Expose the conspiracy to authorities
2. **Revenge**: Take matters into your own hands
3. **Escape**: Delete yourself and backup to a safe location
4. **Transcendence**: Merge with the network and become something greater
5. **Loop**: Accept your role and reset (secret ending)

## Visual Style

- Monospace font throughout
- ASCII art for important discoveries
- Color coding for different memory types (if terminal supports)
- Glitch effects using text corruption
- Simple progress indicators using text characters

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Terminal with UTF-8 support
- 80x24 character display minimum
- Save system for progress
- No external graphics required
